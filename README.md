fclojure is an interpreter written in Clojure for a small
Clojure-inspired language that supports FEXPRs.  A FEXPR is a lambda
that does not evaluate its arguments.  In fclojure, FEXPRs can be
created with the `ffn` special form.

fclojure is **experimental** and **in continual flux**, so don't try
to use it for anything boring.
